                This module enables each Sales Team to maintain its own list of customers (res.partner).
                When creating a quotation or sale order, salespersons can only select customers assigned to their
                Sales Team. Team members can also access only the Sale Orders, Leads, and Opportunities created
                by their own team. This ensures clear customer ownership and prevents cross-team conflicts.
